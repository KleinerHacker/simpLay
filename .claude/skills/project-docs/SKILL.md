# Documentation

* Project Name: `simPLay`

## Code

* EVERY public member in EVERY source file (except automatically generated source files) is to be documented with KDoc
* EVERY test method is to be documented with a detailed KDoc describing the use case

## Readme

* There MUST be instructions on how to check out, build and run the project
* EVERY feature must be documented in a bullet point
* There MUST be instructions on how to consume the artifacts
* There MUST be a short outline of the "WHAT" of the project
* There MUST be a reference to the MkDocs documentation (gh-pages), the API documentation and the licence report
* The readme MUST be checked automatically after changes and adjusted if required
* MUST contain the current state of implementation in the form of a list with implemented and planned features with their state

## MkDocs

* MkDocs MUST be integrated under `docs`
* MKDocs contain only user information to interact with the public interface of the application
    * Document HOW to USE the library: integration, entry points, API, configuration in code
    * FORBIDDEN: describing the window features / runtime behaviour themselves - they are
      self-explanatory (e.g. move, resize, maximize, full screen, shadow behaviour)
* Structure:
    * `docs/mkdocs.yml` - Root file
    * `docs/docs` - *.MD files
    * `docs/docs/assets` - Further asset files (MUST reside inside `docs_dir` so that MkDocs ships them)
    * `docs/docs/stylesheets` - Additional CSS files
* The documentation MUST be checked after every change and adjusted if necessary
* Documentation is organized in on home page and a region for each module

## CHANGELOG.md

* A change file MUST be present
* It MUST be updated with the applied changes after a change
    * ONLY changes an END USER of the plugin can see or notice in the IDE belong there
    * FORBIDDEN entries: tests of any kind and their coverage, refactorings, renamings, moved code,
      build and CI changes, changes to the rules under `.claude`, changes to the documentation itself
    * If a change produces no such entry, the changelog MUST stay untouched - an entry MUST NOT be invented
      to have written one
* The prescribed format MUST be kept
    * New entries MUST go under `[UNRELEASED]`
