# Release Preparation

* The published Gradle artifact version is **not** stored in any file. It is derived at build time
  from the `releaseVersion` project property (`build.gradle.kts`,
  `buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/kotlin-jvm.gradle.kts`,
  `buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/kotlin-multiplatform.gradle.kts`), which `release.yml` passes as the git
  tag name (`-PreleaseVersion=${{ github.ref_name }}`). **Never edit these files for a version bump.**
* Release preparation only updates the **human-readable** version references below, plus the
  changelog. It never creates the git tag and never touches `.github/workflows`.

## Locations to update

* `CHANGELOG.md`:
    * The current `## [UNRELEASED]` section becomes `## [<new version>]`.
    * A fresh, empty `## [UNRELEASED]` section is inserted above it.
    * If `## [UNRELEASED]` has no entries under it, there is nothing releasable - stop and tell the
      user instead of inventing an entry or releasing an empty version.
* `README.md`: every `implementation("org.pcsoft.framework:simplay-<module>:<old version>")` example
  coordinate.
* `docs/docs/<module>/implementation.md` for every module directory under `docs/docs` that has one
  (currently `common`, `console`, `engine`, `fx`, `jvm-pdf`, `jvm-print`, `swing`): the same
  `implementation("org.pcsoft.framework:simplay-<module>:<old version>")` example coordinates.
* Any other occurrence of the exact old version string found by a repository-wide search, **except**:
    * `kotlin-js-store/yarn.lock` (generated, never hand-edited).
    * anything under a module's `build/` output directory.
    * `CHANGELOG.md` entries for a past, already-released version (those are history and stay as
      they were).

## Determining the old version

The old version is the heading of the most recent released section in `CHANGELOG.md`
(`## [<old version>]`, the first `## [...]` heading after `## [UNRELEASED]`).

## Verification

* After editing, re-run a repository-wide search for the old version string outside the excluded
  locations above and confirm nothing releasable was missed.
* Follow the project's standing rules (`.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/rules/*.md`) for everything
  else - plan mode, one edit per file, git usage, German console output - this skill only defines
  *where* the version lives, not how the surrounding workflow runs.
